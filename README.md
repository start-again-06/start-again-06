I’ve recently started sharing some of my projects with like-minded individuals. I enjoy discussing new concepts, exploring the latest advancements, and diving into challenging problems.

🔍 Current Focus:

- **Build Fintech Domain Knowledge** – Learn about payments, lending, investing, credit scoring, fraud detection, and regulations like KYC/AML.

- **Leverage AI/ML Expertise** – Apply LLMs, SLMs, predictive analytics, and agentic/physical AI agents to fintech use cases such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and intelligent automation.

- **Develop Product Management Skills** – Create PRDs, define KPIs, map user workflows, and practice prioritizing features for fintech products.

- **Focus on UX & Data-Driven Decisions** – Design frictionless, trustworthy financial user experiences and make decisions based on analytics and metrics (e.g., transaction success, churn, LTV).

- **Network & Showcase Experience** – Update LinkedIn/resume highlighting AI-driven fintech projects, connect with fintech PMs, and demonstrate end-to-end product thinking.
