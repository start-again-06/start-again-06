Hi GitHub Community! 👋

Anjan Mahapatra is a technically fluent and analytically driven professional with a strong engineering foundation and a growing specialization in AI/ML-enabled products and data-driven decision-making. He has hands-on experience across manufacturing, construction, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) domains, shaping end-to-end product development cycles including problem discovery, market research, requirements gathering, designing system architectures, defining user workflows, and executing go-to-market strategies. Anjan combines technical insight with product vision, ensuring that AI/ML solutions are both impactful and aligned with business objectives.

Rooted in a multidisciplinary background spanning biomedical and computational engineering, Anjan specializes in LLMs, SLMs, AGI, physical AI agents, and agentic AI systems. He excels at designing and deploying intelligent, autonomous, and interactive AI solutions that bridge the gap between virtual models and real-world applications. His approach combines advanced technical system design with a focus on scalability, usability, and strategic alignment, enabling AI-driven products that are both impactful and ethically responsible.

I’ve recently started sharing some of my projects with like-minded individuals. I enjoy discussing new concepts, exploring the latest advancements, and diving into challenging problems.

🔍 Current Focus:

- **Build Fintech Domain Knowledge** – Learn about payments, lending, investing, credit scoring, fraud detection, and regulations like KYC/AML.

- **Leverage AI/ML Expertise** – Apply LLMs, SLMs, predictive analytics, and agentic/physical AI agents to fintech use cases such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and intelligent automation.

- **Develop Product Management Skills** – Create PRDs, define KPIs, map user workflows, and practice prioritizing features for fintech products.

- **Focus on UX & Data-Driven Decisions** – Design frictionless, trustworthy financial user experiences and make decisions based on analytics and metrics (e.g., transaction success, churn, LTV).
